## Hi, I am Aditya Kumar Jha!

I am a third year undergraduate student at **Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur** with a keen interest in 3D Computer Vision, SLAM along with its application in robotics & AR/VR. I have also worked transiently in the field of motion planning and controls system.

I have participated in **10th F1TENTH Autonomous Grand Prix at ICRA 2022** and **University Rover Challenge (URC), 2021** where I learnt and explored various domains of robotics. I have worked on scene reconstruction and was also involved in developing a **GPS-Denied Stereo-based Localisation pipeline for pre-mapped LiDAR environments**. Currently, I am actively exploring and working at the intersection of 3D Computer Vision, Deep Learning and 3D Reconstruction. 

I am open to collaboration and seek to contribute to the field of robotics and AI. Feel free to contact me!
